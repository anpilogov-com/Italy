# Italy
This project was proposed by an anonymous company through a private [Head Hunter](https://hh.ru/employer/5557726) recruiter. The project did not require difficult decisions and was presented in a slightly neat form in Figma. The layout did not require responsive layout, but I took the initiative and made a kind of responsive layout. Thanks to this assignment, such a job appeared in my portfolio. Thank you for this work.

# Technological
Next, the technologies used in the project.

## HTML5
The project used the latest version 5 hypertext markup standard for 2021.

A semantic page layout was applied with adaptation for voiceover.

Synthetic tests were performed using Lighthouse and UX tests were performed  typical human.

## CSS3 (SCSS)
The cascading style preprocessor was used to speed up the description of styles for page objects. Do not judge strictly, this is my first project with the integration of the preprocessor for cascading styles.

Please note: IE may display some elements of the site incorrectly, since the page has not been adapted with polyphony expressions.

## JS + Gulp
The project uses the Gulp engine based on JS to speed up the development and compilation of style files, as well as to minimize the program code.

To install all the necessary components, the NPM was used.
